<h2>About Me </h2>
<p>I’m Suganya S, a second-year B.E. Computer Science and Engineering student at Kalaignarkarunanidhi Institute of Technology, currently maintaining a CGPA of 8.22. I have a strong passion for programming and emerging technologies, with a focus on Python and C.
I’ve worked on innovative projects such as an AI-powered memory enhancement system using deep learning and a smart vehicle number plate recognition system. These projects have sharpened my problem-solving and decision-making skills.
In addition to academics, I’ve actively pursued online certifications in Python, Java, HTML & CSS through Infosys Springboard, and completed a course on Computer Architecture via NPTEL.

I’m always eager to learn and apply new technologies and look forward to gaining real-world experience through internships and collaborative projects.</p>
